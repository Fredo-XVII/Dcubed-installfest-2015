Data^3 Installfest 2015
====================

**Hosted by PyLadies**

Data^3 Installfest: March 6, 6-9pm

Goal: To prepare folks who want to install and learn about Python, R, or both, for the Data^3 event. This workshop will help people 
get both Anaconda (Python) and R installed on their computers and guide them through some basic data analysis tasks in both languages.
Additional resources for learning such as links to online classes and tutorials will also be provided.

Installfest Agenda<br />
6:00 pm: People arrive, grab food and flash drives to start installing using instructions for [Anaconda (Python)](install-python.md), 
[R, and RStudio](install-R.md).<br />
6:30 pm: Workshop leaders will do a brief introduction, walking through the goal, activities, and materials for the evening. 
Volunteers will introduce themselves.<br />
6:50 pm: Complete installation of both Anaconda and R, run through commented script files for [Python](Python-titanic-intro.py) 
and [R](R-titanic-intro.R). Volunteers will help as needed.<br />
8:45 pm: Wrap up, point people to the [additional resources](resources.md) file.<br />

Basic To-Do:<br />
Install Anaconda<br />
Install R<br />
Install RStudio<br />
Save train.csv to computer <br />
Walk through Titanic data analysis in Python <br />
Walk through Titanic data analysis in R <br />
<br />
Details for Anaconda/Python:<br />
To use the iPython Notebook, launch iPython Notebook and import the file. The path for the train.csv file should work if the notebook 
and the data are in the same folder;  if the code doesn’t work, check the path to train.csv. Run the first cell by clicking in the 
cell and hitting Shift + Enter. Make sure you run the first cell first, or the libraries will not import.<br />
<br />
To use Spyder, open Spyder by typing “Spyder” in the command line. Go to File, Open and select Python-titanic-intro.py. The path 
for the train.csv file should work if the notebook and the data are in the same folder;  if the code doesn’t work, check the path 
to train.csv. Use Shift + Enter to run the first cell and go to the next one, or the icon at the top that has a green arrow, a red 
box, and a red arrow. Make sure you run the first cell first, or the libraries will not import.<br />
<br />
Details for R:<br />
To use R, Open RStudio. Go to File, Open File, select R-titanic-intro.R. Follow the instructions to check your working directory 
and then either set it to where the train.csv file is or move the train.csv file to your working directory.<br />
