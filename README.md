Data^3 Installfest 2015
====================

**Hosted by PyLadies**

Data^3 Installfest: March 6, 6-9pm

Goal: To prepare folks who want to install and learn about Python, R, or both, for the Data^3 event. This workshop will help people 
get both Anaconda (Python) and R installed on their computers and guide them through some basic data analysis tasks in both languages.
Additional resources for learning such as links to online classes and tutorials will also be provided.

Agenda
6:00 pm: People arrive, grab food and flash drives to start installing using instructions for [Anaconda (Python)](install-python.md), 
[R, and RStudio](install-R.md).<br />
6:30 pm: Workshop leaders will do a brief introduction, walking through the goal, activities, and materials for the evening. 
Volunteers will introduce themselves.<br />
6:50 pm: Complete installation of both Anaconda and R, run through commented script files for Python and R. Volunteers will help as needed.<br />
8:45 pm: Wrap up, point people to the additional resources file.<br />

Basic To-Do:
Install Anaconda<br />
Install R<br />
Install RStudio<br />
Save test.csv to computer <br />
(do we want to recommend saving the data in the R folder so it's already in the working directory?)
